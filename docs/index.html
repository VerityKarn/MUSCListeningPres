							Alright, so my presentation is titled Heaven and Hell, which is both the title of a Black Sabbath album and a reference found in a series called Guilty Gear, where every match is started with the phrase "Heaven or Hell". This will not be the last reference I talk about, because the presentation could also be called(d), "Why metal is more complex than you may think". Trust me, I'll talk about the connection later.(d)

						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Elucidate my personal experience of Metal</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Demonstrate the modularity of Metal</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Highlight a series I enjoy</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">At least one of you will look up Guilty Gear after this, so it's my win.</p>

						<aside class="notes">

							So, when I was trying to figure out how to approach this presentation, I realized that to talk about the music I enjoy requires heading into possibly controversal interpretations of music overall. So, I needed to approach this from a more systematic angle, where I focused on my own experience of Metal, and why it made me view the genre in the way I do. Thus, my first goal(d) of attempting to elucidate my personal experience of Metal as a genre. My own personal background section will cover that, as well as a following section where I describe why it's so difficult for people to jump into Metal as a genre overall. Jumping from that, I then hope to(d) demonstrate the modularity of Metal as a genre. This bridges from the first, as I attempt to tackle how the outsider's perspective is misaligned with the perspective of the fan, and try to find a good source where even an outsider can see the intention of metal as a genre. This is tied into my third goal, which is to (d) highlight a series I enjoy immensly. Specifically Guilty Gear, which I mentioned before, as I believe it allows for some of the easiest access to the world that Metal fans have seen. Plus, it could get some of you interested in playing some GG with me. At the very least(d) one of you will look up GG after this, so I'll consider this my win.(r)

						<h2>My Background</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">I don't have old pictures of me</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">But I have maps</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, my background. Now, I'll be honest, I've not been the biggest fan of talking about my past, because sometimes it gets uncomfortable for people, and I often feel that people tend to associate my past as something to pity, rather than realizing what I went through was neccessary for me to be who I am today. Rather than being weighed down by my past, I grew from it and became a stronger and more understanding person because of it. My past is not a stone around my neck. Rather, it was like the 7 peccatums of Purgatorio, where each gate could only be opened when I learned to transcend what was around me. Given that my experience of Metal is tied to my journey, it is important for the wider story. Unfortunately though(d), I do not have old pictures of myself, so most of this will have to be taken on faith(get it, it's funny because... eh, you get it). So instead(d), enjoy some maps I put in to give some context.

							My father was a military man, and was deployed to multiple countries, including England, Germany, and Italy. I was born in the last of those, where I only spent the first two years of my life. I can't remember anything from those days, but I do often wonder if my addiction to pizza is more than just being a New Yorker. Apparently this is also the country where I got dropped on my head. Seriously, that actually happened. I do wonder if that made me insane, or if that actually pushed out some of the insanity that was already in there from my parents. If I'm in a mental hospital at some point, we'll know which one it was.(d)

							<p>Culture = NYC + Hick</p>

						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							From Italy, we moved to Cobleskill, New York, because there was family there that offered a house. That was a whole debacle by itself, but the important thing is that this was where the majority of my cultural upbringing came from. The best way to describe the culture is a mix of NYC and rural culture, which we tended to afectionately call "Hick". We were definitely not people who could call themselves "true" New Yorkers, according to those snobs in the Big Apple, but what happened in NYC usually had a big effect in Upstate. We felt this most powerfully during the 9/11 attacks, where the distinction between Upstate and the City vanished. At that point, everyone was just a New Yorker, regardless of how close we were to the epicenter. But, Upstate, and especially Schoharie County, often tried to find its own identity that stood out from NYC. For Coby, and the wider Schoharie County, that was adopting elements from Southern life. There were actually stores nearby where you could go buy Confederate flags, and this was seen as normal. There's a joke I remember traveling around the area that went "Why was the toothbrush invented in Schoharie County? Because if it was invented anywhere else, it would be called the 'teethbrush'.". Honestly, it was an interesting mix.(d)

						<p class="fragment">Hymns</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Now, the aspect of this most relevant to the presentation is the mix of music that was available to me growing up. For the most part, I saw these as sort of backdrops to everything around me, as I could not identify with any of the music around me. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy any of it, but these were things I more heard than listened to, if you understand. The biggest genre available was(d) Country music. It played on half of the radio stations available, and both family and friends enjoyed it. There are a decent number of country songs that I could probably sing to this day, even though it's been years since I've heard them. Outside of country, I also heard quite a bit of(d) Classic Rock. Now, I don't know how to properly categorize this, because the Classic Rock I heard growing up was mostly Bad Company, Foreigner, Queen, The Police, and occasionally AC/DC. Apparently the bands considered Classic Rock have expanded, because now Metallica, Pantera, Green Day, and Van Halen are Classic Rock, which I didn't hear until my teens. It might have been how we classify things, but that could also be the culture I grew up with. Another genre we were regularly exposed to was(d) Musicals, which was definitely an influence from the City. Quite a few people I knew talked about breaking through to the Broadway scene, and a good amount of the theatres around me would focus on what was popular on Broadway for their lineups. The ones I remember most, both because they were staples and because my family participated in them, are Fiddler on the Roof, Lil' Abner, Night in the Woods, and Phantom of the Opera. I actually listened to the soundtrack for Phantom quite a bit, mostly after my parents told me not to listen to Metal. It was basically the most Metal thing I could listen to without getting into trouble. The last genre were(d) LDS Hymns, which I heard at least several times a week. My family, being LDS, was naturally exposed to this music, and there was no way to escape it. And it's the one I least enjoyed, so I mostly tuned those out when I could. But then(d)

							I started going to Middle School, where students from all over the county went to the same building and attended the same classes. The number of students I knew went from roughly 20 to 200, which isn't much, but was quite the jump for young me. That was when cliques started to form, and it was also where I began to fall into a particular crowd(d), the odd mixture of Goths/Emos and general outsiders. Sure, some of us were less enthusiastic about the whole "wear black makeup" thing, but we didn't fit into any other crowd, so we tended to stick together. Most importantly though was the fact that this crowd(d) introduced me to Metal music, which was a whole new experience for me. In the background are actually some bands that they turned me towards. Starting from the left, there was Avenged Sevenfold, Killswitch Engage, and Disturbed. At the time, it was more interesting than captivating, so I mostly(d) listened to the music for the aspect of social inclusion. I did enjoy the music, but I didn't see what the others were getting out of it. It was just sort of cool music that I adopted into my music library. Then, there came the year of (d)

						<h2>2007: The Unholy Trinity Discovery</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Tumultuous point in my life</p>

						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Story: Black Lagoon and Hellsing</li>
							<li class="fragment">Philosophy: Freidrich Nietzsche</li>
							<li class="fragment">Music: Nightwish and Kamelot</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							2007. This was the year that I stumbled upon several different influences that I still dive back into to this day. For context, (d) this was an incredibly tumultuous point in my life. My family had gone through 2 divorces, both of which were still involved in the legal system and required me to regularly talk with my legal representative, social workers, and school officials. At that point in my life, I'd been dealing with that rigamarole for nearly 8 years, and I'd learned more about how to answer in the way I was expected to more so than speak from my own self. Say the right line here, give the right impression there, and just keep everything bottled up, in case you screw it up. And I had to bottle it up, because I was the oldest child. Our parents were too busy getting angry at every little thing and trying to turn us children into weapons they could point at each other. I remember so many times how my siblings and I were screamed at for crying too much, or how we "ruined everything" because we "picked the wrong side". So, I had to make sure not to falter. If my younger siblings saw me crack, then what could they rely on? I had to keep the ship moving, and I had to keep it together, no matter how much I just wanted to curl up and ask for the storm to be over. Add to that the new relationship my father was pursuing, which included two new children to the mix, who came with their own baggage I didn't understand, and a new mother figure that was equally unstable, and I was beginning to fray. The small portion of control I had on my life was beginning to break, and I felt like everything was going to fall apart. Yet, over the course of that year(d), I found three sources of inspiration that kept me going, and gave me a new perspective on the situation.
							<br>
							<br>
							These influences came in three distinct flavors. The first(d) was Story. I discovered two series that were both interesting enough to catch my attention, and had themes that struck a chord with me. There was Black Lagoon, which is the leftmost picture, and Hellsing. Both dealt with the heavy idea of where the line between monster and human can be drawn, and what it means to drive oneself away from humanity. It also helped that both gave me further intruiges to dive into, with Black Lagoon inspiring me to look into the history of the Cold War, and Hellsing inspiring me to watch several Operas. The second(d) was Philosophy, as that was the year I first read Nietzsche. While I don't think 14-year-old me actually understood Nietzsche, the passages where he spoke of transforming oneself into something stronger through suffering was incredibly helpful to my psyche at the time. The third, and the most important to this presentation(d), was the discovery of music that was in line with the previous two, and gave me a new avenue to understand these points. In particular(d)

						<h2>The albums that changed me</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Nightwish's <em>Dark Passion Play</em></p>
						<p class="fragment">Kamelot's <em>The Black Halo</em></p>

						<aside class="notes">

							I stumbled across two albums that struck a deep emotional core that I'd been burying away. There was (d) Nightwish's "Dark Passion Play" and (d) Kamelot's "The Black Halo". From Nightwish's album, there was the song "The Poet and The Pendulum", which seemed to perfectly capture the situation I was in. I remember the first time I heard the lines "I have but two faces, one for the world, one for god save me. I can not cry 'cause the shoulder cries more", and feeling everything I bottled up burst forward in uncontrollable agony, as if I was finally given permission to just let everything loose. To this day, that song is deeply personal to me, and I can not listen to it without being transported back to that moment in my life. It's like a personal wormhole that sends me back to that moment. I'm even having difficulty writing about it, without having to take time to relax myself. To a lesser extent, there are the songs "For the Heart I Once Had", "The Islander", and "Eva", which all capture the idea in different forms.
							<br>
							<br>
							For Kamelot's Album, which I later learned was based on Goethe's Faust Part 2, the song "Abandoned" came at a time where I was having a crisis of faith, where I realized that there was no higher power that made everything understandable. Moving away from religion was incredibly painful, as it was one of the few things I could trust, and "Abandoned" captured the emotional turmoil I was experiencing at that moment. The song "This Pain" felt prophetic at the time, and it's only grown more real through the years. I know I could never truly fix the problems of my family, and I knew that my siblings were going to come away with their own scars. Yet, as the song says "But what was I to do?" But tied into the songs that seemed to bring forward my pain were songs that spoke of the possibility of transcending that pain, which ties into(d)

						<h2>Themes I attached to</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is universal</li>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is difficult and devastating</li>
							<li class="fragment">Yet, suffering is survivable</li>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is opportunity for growth and personal expression</li>
							<li class="fragment">Despite everything else, we can understand each other</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							The Themes I attached to, both from the music and the other discoveries of mine. The first of which was (d) that the suffering I felt was not truly unique to myself. For my young self, this was world-changing. For years, I felt outside it all, believing that nobody saw what was happening. Even those whose jobs were to try and understand felt coldly clinical to me. I was not someone in pain, but an object to study and mold. The experience of finding others who knew what I felt, on some instintual level, and then created something truly beautiful from it, changed my view on how alone I thought myself. There were others out there who had similar experiences to me, even if they were not exactly the same. So, even if those around me couldn't understand, there were those who could. I just had to learn from their stories. And what I learned from their stories was (d) that suffering itself could be difficult and devastating. Regardless of who experiences it, suffering could absolutely consume a person, and push them over the edge towards insanity and ruin. Nobody was above the effects of suffering, and it could leave you a lifeless husk. My experiences over the years only reinforced this understanding, as some I knew chose to end their lives, rather than deal with the pain. I can't blame them.
							<br>
							<br>
							Yet, the experience also taught me (d) that suffering is survivable. Tumbling down past the edge does not mean that you are destined to end, or even that you are destined to come out broken and misshapen. Falling down the abyss of suffering does not mean that you're lost, or that you're forever barred from climbing back up. Because (d) Suffering allows for one to choose how they tumble down. One may find themselves in freefall, but there is no reason not to take the experience for what it is. You can contort yourself into inhuman form, or scrape along the wall, all in the hopes that you land safely. Or, you could let gravity do its job, and simply take in as much as you can. And when you find yourself at the bottom, do your damned hardest to pick yourself up, and figure out how best to try and climb back up. You may lose your footing, and fall back to where you started. Yet, if you're willing to accept the cycle for what it is, then each fall is not an act of destruction, but rather a new lesson learned for the next journey upwards. Each attempt gives you new life and new knowledge, and you use it to make that tiny amount more feasible.
							<br>
							<br>
							Most importantly, (d) the abyss can teach you that despite everything else, we can be understood. Those influences I found were others like me, who were going through their own journey climbing the wall. In their own journies, they found little tricks and truths, and they opted to share these with others. They chose to give their accounts, because it may help another to see the struggles they had. Viewing it in this way, it becomes easier to look around oneself and realize there are others alongside you. You're not a lone wanderer of these depths, but are surrounded by those who are equally distraught. Then, you understand that you could be part of the wider chain. The lessons you've learned could help another, and learning to communicate those lessons becomes a good way to alieviate your own lonliness. You may not be well equipped for the task, and you tend to fail enough in the beginning to wonder if it's possible. But, you keep on trying, just like you keep trying to climb that wall yourself. Because sometimes trying is one of the few things you have left, and trying, despite every little failure, is one of those things that can't be taken from you.(d)

						<h2>The Effects</h2>
						<p class="fragment">A deep need to understand:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">What creates our personal hells</li>
							<li class="fragment">The insanity underlying everyone</li>
							<li class="fragment">The dark joke that is humanity</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							The Effects of this led to (d) a deep-set need to understand several aspects of human life, which I'll likely explore for the rest of my life. To begin with (d) was a need to understand the personal hells that are built around people. We may be in the abyss, but the fact that I couldn't see others around me told me that I had constructed my own vision of the abyss. It wasn't that others <em>could not understand</em>. It was that I put myself into my own personal hell, where I walled out others from understanding. How this works changes from person to person, and so a study of the elemental construction of these personal hells has been an interesting project of mine. There is also the need to understand(d) the insanity underlying everyone. When one is sitting at the bottom, it's easy to look up at those who have not tumbled down with you and wonder how they could stay up there. But, the more you look at their footing, the more you realize how brittle it is. Everybody at the top is just as likely to fall down themselves, but they don't believe themselves capable. Studying the foundations they stand upon, and the reasons for their failure, reveals a deep insanity in how faithful people are to their constructed platforms. They put everything into the belief that their footing is secure, and they don't see how easily they could lose it. This revalution of the "healthy" stereotype has led me to believe that it requires insanity itself to hold such a view, and so understanding that belief in one's footing has been another interesting project of mine. The final effect, and the one that points to my own insanity(d) is the need to understand the dark joke that is humanity. There is no way to properly describe this project of mine, other than learning to laugh at the whole picture. Brittle ground holding up the "healthy", and self-isolation by the "unhealthy". All the while, you watch as others fall, others attempt to climb, and others become ruined. There is some sense of comedy in the whole, but I couldn't tell you what the punchline is. All I could say is that if there is some higher power, their end goal was only to laugh at their creation. So, I laugh, even if only to glimpse at the joke.(r)

							<li class="fragment">Breaking Musical/Metal Stereotype</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							All that being said, there are several difficulties in trying to get someone to see Metal in the same way that I do. First(d), my background is not yours. This seems moot, but I must stress this point. What I experienced, and the ways that Metal changed me, are impossible to recreate. So, how do I go about translating that experience to somebody who is different from myself? How do I create a universal enough picture of Metal as a genre, so that others can get a glimpse of what I experienced? Second(d), and I readily admit this, Metal is freaking weird. Metal thrives on being apart from the pack, and that gets expressed in all sorts of manners. So, how do I convey Metal in order to get another to not be dissuaded by the face value experience of Metal? How can I get somebody to move past the frontal oddity? Third(d), is the issue of breaking through previous musical stereotype of Metal as a genre. Let me explain that last point in better detail(d).

						<h2>Musical Stereotype</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Country is boring guitar music about tradition and rural life</p>
						<p class="fragment">Jazz is an unorganized mess</p>
						<p class="fragment">Rap is basically rythmic talking about gangster life</p>

						<p class="fragment">Metal is angry guitar and demons</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Fans of every genre have come across the stereotypical view of their preferred music, and half of the battle is getting people past that facade. For some quick ones, there is (d) the stereotype that Country is boring guitar music about tradition and rural life. While this does happen, any fan of country would tell you how country has changed over the years, and how multiple country artists have lampshaded this view of the genre. Then there's(d) Jazz being an unorganized mess. Countless amounts of music theorists have debunked this claim, and have even shown that Jazz is a far more complex genre than the average person acknowledges. (d) There's the stereotype that Rap is just some beats with violent lyrics about gang life. You would think that the rise of artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and The Weekend would have dispelled this myth, but I still see it prominently paraded about. (d) There's the old adage that Classical is that boring music made for music theory snobs and the wealthy. To this, I usually point towards Paganini, Vivaldi, or Wagner, who were absolutely the pregenitors of modern rock in their time. Finally(d), there is the myth of Metal being nothing but angry guitar talking about demonic forces. Being a metal fan myself, I get where this comes from, but it's such a shallow look at what the genre holds.(d)

						<h2>Focusing on Metal Stereotype</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Metal expression is both technical and metaphorical</p>
						<p class="fragment">Technical expression through intense virtuosity</p>
						<p class="fragment">Metaphorical expression through dark and vague imagery</p>
						<p class="fragment">Problem of metaphor versus interpretation</p>
						<p class="fragment">"Metal speaks of demons, therefore it is demonic"</p>
						<p class="fragment">Tipper Gore hearings on Metal</p>

						<aside class = "notes">

							So, focusing on the Metal Stereotype, there are several aspects to point towards that I believe is missed on most people's first impressions. Overall, it's a misunderstanding of metal expression(d), which is rooted in both technical and metaphorical musical language. (d) The technical expression of metal is focused on intense virtuosity, mostly through difficult and impressive guitar riffs, bass lines, and drum beats. It's a genre that elevates difficult to recreate sounds, which are usually made by going against musical convention. The ballad structure may be used, but it can often be expanded or warped into new styles that display musical talent that is hard to appreciate from a first viewing. This need to constantly push musical convention is often alienating, so an outsider might just hear the music as pure noise. It's a self feeding loop, where those who appreciate metal tend to be the "in-crowd", while outsiders are just stiffs who don't get it. Given that most metal fans tend to see themselves as outsiders to begin with, it's comforting, but definitely makes it harder to get people into the wider metal conversation. Add to that(d) metal's typical approach to dark and vague imagery to elucidate some deeper meaning, and we can see how the metaphorical aspect of metal gets tied into the mistranslation of the technical aspect. Demons, hell, fire, what have you, are regular images that appear in metal lyrics, and the first impression tends to come across as violent. However, this is where we run into (d) the problem of metaphor versus interpretation. Metaphor, in any medium, is only as good as it's ability to be interpreted. So, a song talking about summoning demons to slay one's enemies could run into a very basic problem. (d) "If it speaks of demons, it must actually mean demons." To a metal fan, the song about summoning demons is likely interpreted as "Bringing forward one's deep emotions to better attack the problems of reality". To an outsider, the song is literally, "I want to summon Hell to kill people." The difference between these interpretations are massive, and the latter was the main driving force for(d) the 1985 Tipper Gore hearings on Metal/Rock/Rap music and public safety. Though, ironically, that fueled each of those genres to become less mainstream. Funny, that.(d)

						<h2>Metal fans versus outsiders</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Outsiders perspective:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Demonic themes</li>
							<li class="fragment">Chaotic, harsh, and dissonant tones</li>
							<li class="fragment">Violent and evil</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Metal fans perspective:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Demons = evil forces within ourselves and others</li>
							<li class="fragment">Life is chaotic, harsh, and dissonant</li>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, to put it simply, there is the (d) outsider perspective built on three principles. Metal(d) contains demonic themes. Metal(d) has Chaotic, harsh, and dissonant tones. And Metal(d) is violent and probably evil. Counter to that is (d) the Metal fan's perspective, which believes that (d) Demons are a stand in for evil forces within ourselves and others, that (d) life is inherently chaotic, harsh, and dissonant, and therefore our music ought to reflect that, and (d) that the world itself is violent and evil, and our music is an attempt to understand it. Metal is a genre that attempts to capture the chaos of the world itself, rather than bring chaos into the world.(d)

							<aside class = "notes">
								
								To acheive this, Metal has three emphases that tend to confuse outsiders, which I've touched on before. First,(d) Metal puts a big emphasis on tonal complexity. Here, I've linked a published article talking about just how wild Rock and Metal tend to go regarding tone. Second,(d) Metal loves to play around with the concept of time, and so achieves temporal complexity. The article linked talks about Dream Theatre's specific brand of this, and how they will change time signatures rapidly for their particular sound. Third(d), is the metaphorical complexity, which I've already talked about enough.(d)

							So, this meant that I had to try and select for music that allowed me to simplify these aspects. Specifically, I needed metal songs that had(d) Relative tonal simplicity(d), a simple enough temporal sense(d), and metaphor that could be explained without writing a whole new project on lyrical interpretation itself. While I don't know if I achieved any of these together, I believe I've found a good mix of them to make the experience much easier to an outsider. Hopefully. With that said, I decided to go with(r)

							As for what that work is, Daisuke is mostly known for(d) being the main creative force behind Guilty Gear. And when I say the main force, I mean that this is a series that is pushed almost entirely by his hand. For example,(d) he is the main character designer for the series, (d) writes and directs the overall narrative, and, most importantly for this presentation(d), is both the writer and producer for the music, while also usually taking vocal or instrumental roles. As his career progressed, he even started helping other series with their music,(d) most prominently Blazblue, where he now helps their sound design department. But, for his music career, it's best we focus on GG.(d)

							Because the amount of music he's made for this series is massive. Focusing only on the mainline series, the albums that Daisuke has created and directed, while also participating in, is still a sizeable list. There's the(d) album for the first game in 1998. Following that (d) is the album for the sequel in 2000. Following that(d) is the album for the sequel to GGX, which started in 2002 and went through 2008. Then came(d) the odd one of the series(d) GG2. Trust me, it's weird to explain. After that(d) was the GG Xrd soundrack, which started in 2014 and finished in 2017. Finally, the last game in the series so far(d) is GG Strive, which was released in 2021, and is still being updated to this day. If you're confused why the albums are stretched over a period of time(d), it's because many of these games had multiple versions, as Downloadable characters with their own themes became available. So, you'd have the initial release, which did come with a purchasable album, but additional albums would come out with the new music made available as the games were updated. It's a consequence of how the gaming industry overall approaches games, so don't worry about that too much.(d)

						<h2>Musical Influence</h2>

						<aside class="notes">

							Now, when it comes to Daisuke's musical influence, there is more than enough to work with, but the problem is figuring out which ones are more relevant than others. The main takeaway for people is that (d) Daisuke loves rock and heavy metal overall. But, it's hard to figure out which groups were more influential than others(d), because almost everything in GG is a reference to some music Daisuke knows of. At the beginning, I've already said that there's a connection to Black Sabbath, but there are way too many to sort through. (d) For a quick example, the main character of the series, who is on the left(d), is called Sol Badguy, for a bunch of story reasons. His real name, however(d), is Fredrich Bulsara, which he had before he became the result of genetic engineering. Don't ask. This is actually(d) a pretty straightforward reference to (d) Freddie Mercury, who was born with the name(d) Farrokh Bulsara, and also had the stage name(d) Mr. Bad Guy. Unfortunately, this is really the only method to understanding Daisuke's influence, because almost everybody is asking him about game development, but very few actually ask him about his music tastes. It's more hermeticism than straight facts. Which, I unfortunately find interesting, so I keep talking about this series way more than I should. Regardless, I'll point out some of the references as we go on, and hopefully that paints enough of a broad picture of Daisuke's taste.(d)

						<p class="fragment">Each song is a character/story theme</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							For this project, I've decided to go with the latest album made by Daisuke(d) which is the Necessary Discrepancy edition of the GG Strive soundtrack. I've chosen it because, again,(d) it's the latest album made for the series, which means it's the one most relevant to the current state of the series. It also allows for more backstory for me to explain the metaphorical subtext. (d)It's also the album that has the most variety of every soundtrack. There are songs that are closer to pop than metal, and some songs that just go straight up jazz on the audience. Though this makes sense, because(d) each song of the album is either a theme explaining each individual character, or part of the story mode. Given the diversity of the cast, it makes sense that each theme is made to capture the essense of the character. So, it allows me to show a part of the wide range that metal can take as a genre, while also giving me a way to point towards a concrete explanation of the themes in the songs. So, let's dive into our first example.(r)

						<aside class="notes">

							The first song I chose for this project is called(d) <em>Love the Subhuman Self</em>, which is(d) the theme of Millia Rage, who you can see to the left. Her name is actually a reference to a thrash metal band from the 80s/90s called Meliah Rage, while she also has a demon in her hair called Angra, which is a metal band from Russia, the country Millia comes from. To explain that oddity, let's explore(d)

							Millia's Story. Now, I'll state here that there are literally enough analyses of each of these characters to write a freaking book about. I'm going to try and give a quick enough overlook focusing on the relevant information for each character's theme to be understandable. If you have further questions on each character, check the wiki, or ask me later. There's a lot to unpack.
							<br>
							<br>
							For Millia, (d)she started out as an orphan that was kidnapped by the Assassin's Guild, and then(d) used for human experimentation on forbidden magic to summon the forbidden demons. That's what led to her hair becoming a weapon. Alongside her was a guy named Zato-1, on the right, which is apparently a pun about a blind swordsman named Zatoichi. Kind of makes sense because he had to give up his sight to gain his demon Eddie, which is either a reference to Eddie Van Halen or the mascot for Iron Maiden, who's called Eddie the Head. Like I said, the evidence is not concrete. While they grew up, Millia and Zato started a relationship(d) which became destructive as time went on. The short version was that Eddie was violent, made Zato violent, abused Millia, she left then vowed to kill Zato, but then Eddie killed Zato, then Zato was resurrected and lost all his memories, but remembered that he cared about Millia, which she just said "fine" to, and now they are kind of co-workers, but also maybe thinking about getting back together? Trust me, this was the shortest way to describe that atom bomb of a relationship. Point is, Zato doesn't remember anything, and Millia is trying to figure out if their relationship could ever be fixed. While they were figuring that out, both of them rose up the ranks of the Assassin's guild, and eventually became the heads of (d) an organization known as the Post-War Administration Bureau. Don't ask, that's a whole other rabbit hole. Instead, let's focus on how all of this is explained through the theme itself.(d)

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Given her backstory, Millia is going through quite a bit internally, and most of it comes through in her theme. To begin with, (d)she never really got over the fact that she's technically possessed by a demon, which is the main point of the first verse, where she vents her anger and doubts about herself. She is also struggling with her relationship with Zato(d), which is the focus of the second verse. The chorus tells us how she's dealing with this situation(d), which is that she believes that she must move forward regardless. Whether these things consume her, or whether she can push through to reach the moonlight, Millia must learn to not only live with these problems, but accept them for what they are. Hence, why she must love the subhuman self.(d)

							<li class="fragment">Underlying Thematic Throughline: Pleading and sad</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Now, the Musical elements of Millia's theme are actually two fold. (d) There is the main sound, which is mostly taken up by harsh, fast, and angry guitar and sythetic instruments. Yet, underneath that(d) is a softer and subtle integration of string and piano music, which pops out to take the main stage at times, but is often swallowed up by the main sound shortly after. Musically(d), the main thematic throughline comes across as unforgiving and angry, but this sound is puncuated by the (d) subtler thematic throughline, which is the outcry of a soul in need of some comfort. I would recommend one listens to this song twice. For the first listen, I'd recommend just absorbing the main sound, while the second listen ought to focus on the subtler elements that lie beneath. As much as I tried to go for simple enough music, a lot of this is hard to hear with only one listen, which is why I split these elements into Main/Underlying sections.(d)

						<aside class="notes">
							
							For the second song, I chose(d) <em>Like A Weed, Naturally, as a Matter of Course</em>, which is the theme song of Testament, the person in the background. They're named after the band <em>Testament</em>, which started in 1983 and is still making music today. One of their moves is called Unholy Diver, which is a reference to one of my favorite albums, <em>Holy Diver</em> by Dio. Anyway, let's move into understanding(d)

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Testament's Story. Again, I'll keep this short and relevant to the theme. So, at first Testament was an orphan. You'll notice that this is a regular pattern for backstories. They were found and raised by the leader of the Crusades, before eventually(d) being kidnapped and experimented on for genetic weapon projects called GEARs. Another regular pattern for backstories in GG. Eventually, the Command GEAR, Justice, rebeled and tried to wipe out humanity by controlling all the other GEARs in existence,(d) including Testament. What follows was the first two games of the series, where Justice is eventually defeated and Testament is freed from her control. Now straddled with a lifetime of guilt and confusion, Testament finds Justice's daughter, Dizzy, and(d) decides to try and protect her from the world. That story is GGX2, which is what the background art is from. Eventually, Dizzy leaves and Testament(d) decides to secluded themself from the world and rediscover their purpose. Testament's return to the series in Strive is after that long time in solitude, and the lessons they learned while away from everybody else.(d)

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							The new image is Testament in Strive, 7 years after the events of GGX2. One thing to note moving forward is that part of that discovery was coming to terms with their gender identity, and they now identify as <em>mu-gender</em>, which is a Japanese term for a non-binary person who feels that they are both genders combined. Basically, they see themselves as both male and female. In the theme, you'll hear the song switch between the pronouns "he" and "she". That's the reason why. Beyond the identity aspect, Testament's theme tells us how their life philosophy has changed, and gives us a good look into the answers they found while in solitude. To start(d), Testament now sees all life as connected, and specifically themself as "one of a chain". They also(d) believe that life itself is neither good or evil. "It's just life". And because it's just life(d), it's worth living for its own sake, rather than some higher purpose. And because life is worth living for its own sake(d), Testament doesn't want to change the world, but simply observe it. Though, they're more than aware of how others view them as a potentially destructive force in the world.(d)

						<aside class="notes">
							
							As for the Musical Elements of the Theme, I ought to point out how Testament's theme utilizes the exact same set of instruments as Millia's theme, but how they are applied gives off two incredibly different senses of emotional connection. It's also like Millia's, in that I'd recommend at least two passthroughs, with each focused on the main throughline and the underlying throughline. For the main sound(d), there are Energetic and usually rising Vocals, Guitar and Strings. For the Underlying sound(d), there is the Guitar and Bass setting a pulsing rythmn in Gallop step. When I say pulsing, I mean there is a baseline note, with the instrument jumping up in pitch at regular intervals. These patterns appear often in Metal music, so recognizing both a Gallop and Pulse is helpful overall. Anyway, the main thematic throughline(d) is a triumphant, joyful rising, like their soul is taking flight. Underneath that(d) is the subtle throughline of a fast but grounded gallop. So while their soul is soaring, their perception is firmly in place and moving forward with their new perspective.(d)

							For the third song, it's time that we took a dip into the deep end of the pool. Taking the elements from the first two, now we can try to put together the weird side of metal, where the song's sense of time and direction is much harder to grasp.(d) For that, I've gone with <em>Drift</em>, which is(d) the theme of Happy Chaos(HC). And, funny enough, Happy Chaos is a perfect way to describe both the character and theme.(d)

							<li class="fragment">Began to believe that Chaos made better stories</li>
							<li class="fragment">Influenced events from the Backyard to create Chaos</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, who is HC? Well, if you thought the first two backstories were convoluted and hard to grasp, get ready, because it's time to get crazy. HC is actually(d) the original discoverer of Magic as a tenable force and science within the world of GG, and the Backyard, which is a higher dimension that is basically a computer running the actual universe that GG is set in. Yes, the story goes freaking meta at one point, and literally tells the characters that they are programmed simulations within a machine running the universe. While most of the characters tend to take this in stride and keep living their lives, HC was intruiged by the Backyard(d), and decided to seclude himself in this new dimension. From there, he began to see the GG universe as a story, and started to become entirely detached from it. There's actually several points where he directly points out the tropes of the Story Mode, and even plays right into them, just because that makes the story more engaging. Basically, HC has become a weird halfway point between the characters of the story, and us the audience, who sees the world from the outside. Personally, he almost seems like a criticism of people like me, who try way too hard to explain how GG works. Regardless(d), HC is basically the embodiment of "Stare into the abyss, and it stares back." His discovery forever changed him, and he's something that's almost impossible to explain. But, because he sees the events of the world of GG as a Story, he began to differentiate between what makes a good story and a bad story.(d) The answer that he came across was that a good story needs to push the characters to their limits. If a hero is not challenged, then the victory doesn't feel earned. And if it's too difficult, then the hero fails. So, how to make a story that pushes the limits, while also "hoping that you guys win"? Well(d), from the Backyard he began to influence the wider story in little ways. A slight tragedy here, and bit of misfortune there, and the world was placed in the perfect position to bring forward strong characters who made the story that much more interesting. Because the one thing HC wants is to avoid a boring story, even if that means he has to put himself in the middle of it. Again, he's weird. It's best to just not think about it too much.(d)

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, the main ideas of the theme, we can start with a doozy of an idea(d), that truth is not the same as reality. For GG, this makes sense, because there is literally a "real" universe that is controlled by another dimension, which means that their "reality" is not the "truth". And because the "truth" is not "reality"(d), then everything can be best explained and understood as a story. And the best stories(d) are those which are violent storms followed by beautiful skies. Said another way, the best stories are struggling and suffering followed by a calm and peaceful resolution. As for HC's motivation(d), he has none, except to keep the story going forever. Hence the line(d) "Please don't stop the flow", after he reaches his own calm seas. No matter what, he just keeps diving in, because it's far more interesting that way.(d)

							For the musical elements of the theme, I must reiterate that we are jumping into the weird side of metal a bit here. What that means is that I can't really rely on the previous main vs underlying elements I used for the last two songs. This song actively tries to defy catagorizing, so unfortunately, this is the best way to explain it. Again, remember that this is the theme for Happy Chaos, so(d) the song is best understood as different forms of a smile. By that, I mean that the song goes through(d) the suave smirk with a swagger(d), the hazy but slightly deranged grin(d), the manic, cackling, and terrifying laugh(d), and the hopeful, estatic smile.(d) Seriously, this is the best explanation I could come up with. You'll either get it, or you won't.(d)

							This is the character information for each one I talked about in this presentation. If you want to know exactly what happened, or you think I may have left out important information, check out these pages. Seriously, there is a lot to unpack with each of these characters, so don't just trust my short summaries. With that, we've come to the end, and I'll now be taking questions.
