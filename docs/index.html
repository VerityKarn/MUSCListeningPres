							Alright, so my presentation is titled Heaven and Hell, which is both the title of a Black Sabbath album and a reference found in a series called Guilty Gear, where every match is started with the phrase "Heaven or Hell". This will not be the last reference I talk about, because the presentation could also be called(d), "Why metal is more complex than you may think". Trust me, I'll talk about the connection later.(d)

						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Elucidate my personal experience of Metal</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Demonstrate the modularity of Metal</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up fade-in-then-semi-out">Highlight a series I enjoy</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">At least one of you will look up Guilty Gear after this, so it's my win.</p>

						<aside class="notes">

							So, when I was trying to figure out how to approach this presentation, I realized that to talk about the music I enjoy requires heading into possibly controversal interpretations of music overall. So, I needed to approach this from a more systematic angle, where I focused on my own experience of Metal, and why it made me view the genre in the way I do. Thus, my first goal(d) of attempting to elucidate my personal experience of Metal as a genre. My own personal background section will cover that, as well as a following section where I describe why it's so difficult for people to jump into Metal as a genre overall. Jumping from that, I then hope to(d) demonstrate the modularity of Metal as a genre. This bridges from the first, as I attempt to tackle how the outsider's perspective is misaligned with the perspective of the fan, and try to find a good source where even an outsider can see the intention of metal as a genre. This is tied into my third goal, which is to (d) highlight a series I enjoy immensly. Specifically Guilty Gear, which I mentioned before, as I believe it allows for some of the easiest access to the world that Metal fans have seen. Plus, it could get some of you interested in playing some GG with me. At the very least(d) one of you will look up GG after this, so I'll consider this my win.(r)

						<h2>My Background</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">I don't have old pictures of me</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">But I have maps</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, my background. Now, I'll be honest, I've not been the biggest fan of talking about my past, because sometimes it gets uncomfortable for people, and I often feel that people tend to associate my past as something to pity, rather than realizing what I went through was neccessary for me to be who I am today. Rather than being weighed down by my past, I grew from it and became a stronger and more understanding person because of it. My past is not a stone around my neck. Rather, it was like the 7 peccatums of Purgatorio, where each gate could only be opened when I learned to transcend what was around me. Given that my experience of Metal is tied to my journey, it is important for the wider story. Unfortunately though(d), I do not have old pictures of myself, so most of this will have to be taken on faith(get it, it's funny because... eh, you get it). So instead(d), enjoy some maps I put in to give some context.

							My father was a military man, and was deployed to multiple countries, including England, Germany, and Italy. I was born in the last of those, where I only spent the first two years of my life. I can't remember anything from those days, but I do often wonder if my addiction to pizza is more than just being a New Yorker. Apparently this is also the country where I got dropped on my head. Seriously, that actually happened. I do wonder if that made me insane, or if that actually pushed out some of the insanity that was already in there from my parents. If I'm in a mental hospital at some point, we'll know which one it was.(d)

							<p>Grew up in Cobleskill, NY</p>
							<p>Culture = NYC + Hick</p>

						</div>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							From Italy, we moved to Cobleskill, New York, because there was family there that offered a house. That was a whole debacle by itself, but the important thing is that this was where the majority of my cultural upbringing came from. The best way to describe the culture is a mix of NYC and rural culture, which we tended to afectionately call "Hick". We were definitely not people who could call themselves "true" New Yorkers, according to those snobs in the Big Apple, but what happened in NYC usually had a big effect in Upstate. We felt this most powerfully during the 9/11 attacks, where the distinction between Upstate and the City vanished. At that point, everyone was just a New Yorker, regardless of how close we were to the epicenter. But, Upstate, and especially Schoharie County, often tried to find its own identity that stood out from NYC. For Coby, and the wider Schoharie County, that was adopting elements from Southern life. There were actually stores nearby where you could go buy Confederate flags, and this was seen as normal. There's a joke I remember traveling around the area that went "Why was the toothbrush invented in Schoharie County? Because if it was invented anywhere else, it would be called the 'teethbrush'.". Honestly, it was an interesting mix.(d)

						<h2>Music Culture</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Country</p>
						<p class="fragment">Classic Rock</p>
						<p class="fragment">Musicals</p>
						<p class="fragment">Hymns</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Now, the aspect of this most relevant to the presentation is the mix of music that was available to me growing up. For the most part, I saw these as sort of backdrops to everything around me, as I could not identify with any of the music around me. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy any of it, but these were things I more heard than listened to, if you understand. The biggest genre available was(d) Country music. It played on half of the radio stations available, and both family and friends enjoyed it. There are a decent number of country songs that I could probably sing to this day, even though it's been years since I've heard them. Outside of country, I also heard quite a bit of(d) Classic Rock. Now, I don't know how to properly categorize this, because the Classic Rock I heard growing up was mostly Bad Company, Foreigner, Queen, The Police, and occasionally AC/DC. Apparently the bands considered Classic Rock have expanded, because now Metallica, Pantera, Green Day, and Van Halen are Classic Rock, which I didn't hear until my teens. It might have been how we classify things, but that could also be the culture I grew up with. Another genre we were regularly exposed to was(d) Musicals, which was definitely an influence from the City. Quite a few people I knew talked about breaking through to the Broadway scene, and a good amount of the theatres around me would focus on what was popular on Broadway for their lineups. The ones I remember most, both because they were staples and because my family participated in them, are Fiddler on the Roof, Lil' Abner, Night in the Woods, and Phantom of the Opera. I actually listened to the soundtrack for Phantom quite a bit, mostly after my parents told me not to listen to Metal. It was basically the most Metal thing I could listen to without getting into trouble. The last genre were(d) LDS Hymns, which I heard at least several times a week. My family, being LDS, was naturally exposed to this music, and there was no way to escape it. And it's the one I least enjoyed, so I mostly tuned those out when I could. But then(d)

							I started going to Middle School, where students from all over the county went to the same building and attended the same classes. The number of students I knew went from roughly 20 to 200, which isn't much, but was quite the jump for young me. That was when cliques started to form, and it was also where I began to fall into a particular crowd(d), the odd mixture of Goths/Emos and general outsiders. Sure, some of us were less enthusiastic about the whole "wear black makeup" thing, but we didn't fit into any other crowd, so we tended to stick together. Most importantly though was the fact that this crowd(d) introduced me to Metal music, which was a whole new experience for me. In the background are actually some bands that they turned me towards. Starting from the left, there was Avenged Sevenfold, Killswitch Engage, and Disturbed. At the time, it was more interesting than captivating, so I mostly(d) listened to the music for the aspect of social inclusion. I did enjoy the music, but I didn't see what the others were getting out of it. It was just sort of cool music that I adopted into my music library. Then, there came the year of (d)

						<h2>2007: The Unholy Trinity Discovery</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Tumultuous point in my life</p>

						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Story: Black Lagoon and Hellsing</li>
							<li class="fragment">Philosophy: Freidrich Nietzsche</li>
							<li class="fragment">Music: Nightwish and Kamelot</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							2007. This was the year that I stumbled upon several different influences that I still dive back into to this day. For context, (d) this was an incredibly tumultuous point in my life. My family had gone through 2 divorces, both of which were still involved in the legal system and required me to regularly talk with my legal representative, social workers, and school officials. At that point in my life, I'd been dealing with that rigamarole for nearly 8 years, and I'd learned more about how to answer in the way I was expected to more so than speak from my own self. Say the right line here, give the right impression there, and just keep everything bottled up, in case you screw it up. And I had to bottle it up, because I was the oldest child. Our parents were too busy getting angry at every little thing and trying to turn us children into weapons they could point at each other. I remember so many times how my siblings and I were screamed at for crying too much, or how we "ruined everything" because we "picked the wrong side". So, I had to make sure not to falter. If my younger siblings saw me crack, then what could they rely on? I had to keep the ship moving, and I had to keep it together, no matter how much I just wanted to curl up and ask for the storm to be over. Add to that the new relationship my father was pursuing, which included two new children to the mix, who came with their own baggage I didn't understand, and a new mother figure that was equally unstable, and I was beginning to fray. The small portion of control I had on my life was beginning to break, and I felt like everything was going to fall apart. Yet, over the course of that year(d), I found three sources of inspiration that kept me going, and gave me a new perspective on the situation.
							<br>
							<br>
							These influences came in three distinct flavors. The first(d) was Story. I discovered two series that were both interesting enough to catch my attention, and had themes that struck a chord with me. There was Black Lagoon, which is the leftmost picture, and Hellsing. Both dealt with the heavy idea of where the line between monster and human can be drawn, and what it means to drive oneself away from humanity. It also helped that both gave me further intruiges to dive into, with Black Lagoon inspiring me to look into the history of the Cold War, and Hellsing inspiring me to watch several Operas. The second(d) was Philosophy, as that was the year I first read Nietzsche. While I don't think 14-year-old me actually understood Nietzsche, the passages where he spoke of transforming oneself into something stronger through suffering was incredibly helpful to my psyche at the time. The third, and the most important to this presentation(d), was the discovery of music that was in line with the previous two, and gave me a new avenue to understand these points. In particular(d)

						<h2>The albums that changed me</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Nightwish's <em>Dark Passion Play</em></p>
						<p class="fragment">Kamelot's <em>The Black Halo</em></p>

						<aside class="notes">

							I stumbled across two albums that struck a deep emotional core that I'd been burying away. There was (d) Nightwish's "Dark Passion Play" and (d) Kamelot's "The Black Halo". From Nightwish's album, there was the song "The Poet and The Pendulum", which seemed to perfectly capture the situation I was in. I remember the first time I heard the lines "I have but two faces, one for the world, one for god save me. I can not cry 'cause the shoulder cries more", and feeling everything I bottled up burst forward in uncontrollable agony, as if I was finally given permission to just let everything loose. To this day, that song is deeply personal to me, and I can not listen to it without being transported back to that moment in my life. It's like a personal wormhole that sends me back to that moment. I'm even having difficulty writing about it, without having to take time to relax myself. To a lesser extent, there are the songs "For the Heart I Once Had", "The Islander", and "Eva", which all capture the idea in different forms.
							<br>
							<br>
							For Kamelot's Album, which I later learned was based on Goethe's Faust Part 2, the song "Abandoned" came at a time where I was having a crisis of faith, where I realized that there was no higher power that made everything understandable. Moving away from religion was incredibly painful, as it was one of the few things I could trust, and "Abandoned" captured the emotional turmoil I was experiencing at that moment. The song "This Pain" felt prophetic at the time, and it's only grown more real through the years. I know I could never truly fix the problems of my family, and I knew that my siblings were going to come away with their own scars. Yet, as the song says "But what was I to do?" But tied into the songs that seemed to bring forward my pain were songs that spoke of the possibility of transcending that pain, which ties into(d)

						<h2>Themes I attached to</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is universal</li>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is difficult and devastating</li>
							<li class="fragment">Yet, suffering is survivable</li>
							<li class="fragment">Suffering is opportunity for growth and personal expression</li>
							<li class="fragment">Despite everything else, we can understand each other</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							The Themes I attached to, both from the music and the other discoveries of mine. The first of which was (d) that the suffering I felt was not truly unique to myself. For my young self, this was world-changing. For years, I felt outside it all, believing that nobody saw what was happening. Even those whose jobs were to try and understand felt coldly clinical to me. I was not someone in pain, but an object to study and mold. The experience of finding others who knew what I felt, on some instintual level, and then created something truly beautiful from it, changed my view on how alone I thought myself. There were others out there who had similar experiences to me, even if they were not exactly the same. So, even if those around me couldn't understand, there were those who could. I just had to learn from their stories. And what I learned from their stories was (d) that suffering itself could be difficult and devastating. Regardless of who experiences it, suffering could absolutely consume a person, and push them over the edge towards insanity and ruin. Nobody was above the effects of suffering, and it could leave you a lifeless husk. My experiences over the years only reinforced this understanding, as some I knew chose to end their lives, rather than deal with the pain. I can't blame them.
							<br>
							<br>
							Yet, the experience also taught me (d) that suffering is survivable. Tumbling down past the edge does not mean that you are destined to end, or even that you are destined to come out broken and misshapen. Falling down the abyss of suffering does not mean that you're lost, or that you're forever barred from climbing back up. Because (d) Suffering allows for one to choose how they tumble down. One may find themselves in freefall, but there is no reason not to take the experience for what it is. You can contort yourself into inhuman form, or scrape along the wall, all in the hopes that you land safely. Or, you could let gravity do its job, and simply take in as much as you can. And when you find yourself at the bottom, do your damned hardest to pick yourself up, and figure out how best to try and climb back up. You may lose your footing, and fall back to where you started. Yet, if you're willing to accept the cycle for what it is, then each fall is not an act of destruction, but rather a new lesson learned for the next journey upwards. Each attempt gives you new life and new knowledge, and you use it to make that tiny amount more feasible.
							<br>
							<br>
							Most importantly, (d) the abyss can teach you that despite everything else, we can be understood. Those influences I found were others like me, who were going through their own journey climbing the wall. In their own journies, they found little tricks and truths, and they opted to share these with others. They chose to give their accounts, because it may help another to see the struggles they had. Viewing it in this way, it becomes easier to look around oneself and realize there are others alongside you. You're not a lone wanderer of these depths, but are surrounded by those who are equally distraught. Then, you understand that you could be part of the wider chain. The lessons you've learned could help another, and learning to communicate those lessons becomes a good way to alieviate your own lonliness. You may not be well equipped for the task, and you tend to fail enough in the beginning to wonder if it's possible. But, you keep on trying, just like you keep trying to climb that wall yourself. Because sometimes trying is one of the few things you have left, and trying, despite every little failure, is one of those things that can't be taken from you.(d)

						<h2>The Effects</h2>
						<p class="fragment">A deep need to understand:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">What creates our personal hells</li>
							<li class="fragment">The insanity underlying everyone</li>
							<li class="fragment">The dark joke that is humanity</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							The Effects of this led to (d) a deep-set need to understand several aspects of human life, which I'll likely explore for the rest of my life. To begin with (d) was a need to understand the personal hells that are built around people. We may be in the abyss, but the fact that I couldn't see others around me told me that I had constructed my own vision of the abyss. It wasn't that others <em>could not understand</em>. It was that I put myself into my own personal hell, where I walled out others from understanding. How this works changes from person to person, and so a study of the elemental construction of these personal hells has been an interesting project of mine. There is also the need to understand(d) the insanity underlying everyone. When one is sitting at the bottom, it's easy to look up at those who have not tumbled down with you and wonder how they could stay up there. But, the more you look at their footing, the more you realize how brittle it is. Everybody at the top is just as likely to fall down themselves, but they don't believe themselves capable. Studying the foundations they stand upon, and the reasons for their failure, reveals a deep insanity in how faithful people are to their constructed platforms. They put everything into the belief that their footing is secure, and they don't see how easily they could lose it. This revalution of the "healthy" stereotype has led me to believe that it requires insanity itself to hold such a view, and so understanding that belief in one's footing has been another interesting project of mine. The final effect, and the one that points to my own insanity(d) is the need to understand the dark joke that is humanity. There is no way to properly describe this project of mine, other than learning to laugh at the whole picture. Brittle ground holding up the "healthy", and self-isolation by the "unhealthy". All the while, you watch as others fall, others attempt to climb, and others become ruined. There is some sense of comedy in the whole, but I couldn't tell you what the punchline is. All I could say is that if there is some higher power, their end goal was only to laugh at their creation. So, I laugh, even if only to glimpse at the joke.(r)

							<li class="fragment">Breaking Musical/Metal Stereotype</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							All that being said, there are several difficulties in trying to get someone to see Metal in the same way that I do. First(d), my background is not yours. This seems moot, but I must stress this point. What I experienced, and the ways that Metal changed me, are impossible to recreate. So, how do I go about translating that experience to somebody who is different from myself? How do I create a universal enough picture of Metal as a genre, so that others can get a glimpse of what I experienced? Second(d), and I readily admit this, Metal is freaking weird. Metal thrives on being apart from the pack, and that gets expressed in all sorts of manners. So, how do I convey Metal in order to get another to not be dissuaded by the face value experience of Metal? How can I get somebody to move past the frontal oddity? Third(d), is the issue of breaking through previous musical stereotype of Metal as a genre. Let me explain that last point in better detail(d).

						<h2>Musical Stereotype</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Country is boring guitar music about tradition and rural life</p>
						<p class="fragment">Jazz is an unorganized mess</p>
						<p class="fragment">Rap is basically rythmic talking about gangster life</p>
						<p class="fragment">Classical is boring music made for snobs</p>
						<p class="fragment">Metal is angry guitar and demons</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							Fans of every genre have come across the stereotypical view of their preferred music, and half of the battle is getting people past that facade. For some quick ones, there is (d) the stereotype that Country is boring guitar music about tradition and rural life. While this does happen, any fan of country would tell you how country has changed over the years, and how multiple country artists have lampshaded this view of the genre. Then there's(d) Jazz being an unorganized mess. Countless amounts of music theorists have debunked this claim, and have even shown that Jazz is a far more complex genre than the average person acknowledges. (d) There's the stereotype that Rap is just some beats with violent lyrics about gang life. You would think that the rise of artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and The Weekend would have dispelled this myth, but I still see it prominently paraded about. (d) There's the old adage that Classical is that boring music made for music theory snobs and the wealthy. To this, I usually point towards Paganini, Vivaldi, or Wagner, who were absolutely the pregenitors of modern rock in their time. Finally(d), there is the myth of Metal being nothing but angry guitar talking about demonic forces. Being a metal fan myself, I get where this comes from, but it's such a shallow look at what the genre holds.(d)

						<h2>Focusing on Metal Stereotype</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Metal expression is both technical and metaphorical</p>
						<p class="fragment">Technical expression through intense virtuosity</p>
						<p class="fragment">Metaphorical expression through dark and vague imagery</p>
						<p class="fragment">Problem of metaphor versus interpretation</p>
						<p class="fragment">"Metal speaks of demons, therefore it is demonic"</p>
						<p class="fragment">Tipper Gore hearings on Metal</p>

						<aside class = "notes">

							So, focusing on the Metal Stereotype, there are several aspects to point towards that I believe is missed on most people's first impressions. Overall, it's a misunderstanding of metal expression(d), which is rooted in both technical and metaphorical musical language. (d) The technical expression of metal is focused on intense virtuosity, mostly through difficult and impressive guitar riffs, bass lines, and drum beats. It's a genre that elevates difficult to recreate sounds, which are usually made by going against musical convention. The ballad structure may be used, but it can often be expanded or warped into new styles that display musical talent that is hard to appreciate from a first viewing. This need to constantly push musical convention is often alienating, so an outsider might just hear the music as pure noise. It's a self feeding loop, where those who appreciate metal tend to be the "in-crowd", while outsiders are just stiffs who don't get it. Given that most metal fans tend to see themselves as outsiders to begin with, it's comforting, but definitely makes it harder to get people into the wider metal conversation. Add to that(d) metal's typical approach to dark and vague imagery to elucidate some deeper meaning, and we can see how the metaphorical aspect of metal gets tied into the mistranslation of the technical aspect. Demons, hell, fire, what have you, are regular images that appear in metal lyrics, and the first impression tends to come across as violent. However, this is where we run into (d) the problem of metaphor versus interpretation. Metaphor, in any medium, is only as good as it's ability to be interpreted. So, a song talking about summoning demons to slay one's enemies could run into a very basic problem. (d) "If it speaks of demons, it must actually mean demons." To a metal fan, the song about summoning demons is likely interpreted as "Bringing forward one's deep emotions to better attack the problems of reality". To an outsider, the song is literally, "I want to summon Hell to kill people." The difference between these interpretations are massive, and the latter was the main driving force for(d) the 1985 Tipper Gore hearings on Metal/Rock/Rap music and public safety. Though, ironically, that fueled each of those genres to become less mainstream. Funny, that.(d)

						<h2>Metal fans versus outsiders</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Outsiders perspective:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Demonic themes</li>
							<li class="fragment">Chaotic, harsh, and dissonant tones</li>
							<li class="fragment">Violent and evil</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Metal fans perspective:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Demons = evil forces within ourselves and others</li>
							<li class="fragment">Life is chaotic, harsh, and dissonant</li>
							<li class="fragment">The world is violent and evil, and we wish to understand it</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							
							So, to put it simply, there is the (d) outsider perspective built on three principles. Metal(d) contains demonic themes. Metal(d) has Chaotic, harsh, and dissonant tones. And Metal(d) is violent and probably evil. Counter to that is (d) the Metal fan's perspective, which believes that (d) Demons are a stand in for evil forces within ourselves and others, that (d) life is inherently chaotic, harsh, and dissonant, and therefore our music ought to reflect that, and (d) that the world itself is violent and evil, and our music is an attempt to understand it. Metal is a genre that attempts to capture the chaos of the world itself, rather than bring chaos into the world.(d)

							<h2>Important musical elements of Metal</h2>
							<p class="fragment">Emphasis on <a href="https://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.04.10.4/mto.04.10.4.w_everett.html">tonal complexity</a></p>
							<p class="fragment">Emphasis on <a href="https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.13.19.2/mto.13.19.2.mccandless.html">temporal modularity</a></p>
							<p class="fragment">Emphasis on difficult and vague metaphor</p>

							<aside class = "notes">
								
								To acheive this, Metal has three emphases that tend to confuse outsiders, which I've touched on before. First,(d) Metal puts a big emphasis on tonal complexity. Here, I've linked a published article talking about just how wild Rock and Metal tend to go regarding tone. Second,(d) Metal loves to play around with the concept of time, and so achieves temporal complexity. The article linked talks about Dream Theatre's specific brand of this, and how they will change time signatures rapidly for their particular sound. Third(d), is the metaphorical complexity, which I've already talked about enough.(d)

						<h2>What I selected for</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Relative tonal simplicity</p>
						<p class="fragment">Simple temporal sense</p>
						<p class="fragment">Explainable metaphor</p>

						<aside class = "notes">
							
							So, this meant that I had to try and select for music that allowed me to simplify these aspects. Specifically, I needed metal songs that had(d) Relative tonal simplicity(d), a simple enough temporal sense(d), and metaphor that could be explained without writing a whole new project on lyrical interpretation itself. While I don't know if I achieved any of these together, I believe I've found a good mix of them to make the experience much easier to an outsider. Hopefully. With that said, I decided to go with(r)
